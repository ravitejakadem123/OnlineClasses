    1.ngRoute
    2.ui.router

 Steps to design the single page application by using ngRoute Module.

 1.Download the ngRoute Module by using bower.
 2.Add the ngRoute dependency
 3.create two templates
 4.create the controllers (two).
 5.Do the Mappings:

       Rules of Mappings
       1.mapping should be do in config phase
       2.mapping should be in the form of a key && value pairs
            --keys are the user defined keys (key should be start with '/').
            --keys should be in source template.(index.html)

   to meet this two rules we need to dependent on predefined object
