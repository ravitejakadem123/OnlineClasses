In AngularJS we can provide communication between controllers in 4 ways:

1.broadcast
2.emit
3.rootScope
4.services

broadcast:

--when ever parent controller shares the data,automatically all the child controllers can listen to the data.

emit:

sharing the data from child controllers to parent controllers called as Emit Communication.
